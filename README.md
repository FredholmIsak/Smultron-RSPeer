#Smultron RSPeer

Just a personal project.
Trying to make building tree scripts as easy as possible. 

#Example
Lets make a bot which goes to a area with trees and cuts them.
If the inventory is full it should bank it.

```


@ScriptMeta(desc = "playing around", developer = "smultron", name = "Playground")
public class Playground extends MullbarScript {

	@Override
	public Task nextTask() {

        Task unbank = new 

	}
}


```
